    <p>
      63. He who is a thorough teacher takes things seriously&mdash;and even

      65. The charm of knowledge would be small, were it not so much shame has
      to be overcome on the way to it.
    </p>

      sin.
    </p>
    <p>

      deceived, and exploited might be the diffidence of a God among men.
    </p>
    <p>
      67. Love to one only is a barbarity, for it is exercised at the expense of
      all others. Love to God also!
    </p>
    <p>
      68. "I did that," says my memory. "I could not have done that," says my

      always recurs.
    </p>

      "above thee," thou lackest the eye of the discerning one.
    </p>
    <p>
      72. It is not the strength, but the duration of great sentiments that
      makes great men.

      pride.
    </p>

      76. Under peaceful conditions the militant man attacks himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      77. With his principles a man seeks either to dominate, or justify, or
      honour, or reproach, or conceal his habits: two men with the same
      principles probably seek fundamentally different ends therewith.
    </p>
    <p>
      78. He who despises himself, nevertheless esteems himself thereby, as a
      despiser.
    </p>
    <p>

      its sediment: its dregs come up.
    </p>
    <p>
      80. A thing that is explained ceases to concern us&mdash;What did the God
      mean who gave the advice, "Know thyself!" Did it perhaps imply "Cease to
      be concerned about thyself! become objective!"&mdash;And Socrates?&mdash;And
      the "scientific man"?
    </p>
    <p>
      81. It is terrible to die of thirst at sea. Is it necessary that you
      should so salt your truth that it will no longer&mdash;quench thirst?
    </p>
    <p>
      82. "Sympathy for all"&mdash;would be harshness and tyranny for THEE, my
      good neighbour.
    </p>
    <p>
      83. INSTINCT&mdash;When the house is on fire one forgets even the dinner&mdash;Yes,

    </p>
    <p>
      86. In the background of all their personal vanity, women themselves have
      still their impersonal scorn&mdash;for "woman".
    </p>
    <p>
      87. FETTERED HEART, FREE SPIRIT&mdash;When one firmly fetters one's heart
      and keeps it prisoner, one can allow one's spirit many liberties: I said
      this once before But people do not believe it when I say so, unless they
      know it already.
    </p>

    </p>

      92. Who has not, at one time or another&mdash;sacrificed himself for the
      sake of his good name?
    </p>
    <p>

      seriousness that one had as a child at play.
    </p>
    <p>
      95. To be ashamed of one's immorality is a step on the ladder at the end
      of which one is ashamed also of one's morality.
    </p>
    <p>
      96. One should part from life as Ulysses parted from Nausicaa&mdash;blessing
      it rather than in love with it.
    </p>
    <p>
      97. What? A great man? I always see merely the play-actor of his own
      ideal.
    </p>
    <p>
      98. When one trains one's conscience, it kisses one while it bites.
    </p>
    <p>
      99. THE DISAPPOINTED ONE SPEAKS&mdash;"I listened for the echo and I heard
      only praise."
    </p>
    <p>
      100. We all feign to ourselves that we are simpler than we are, we thus
      relax ourselves away from our fellows.
    </p>
    <p>
      101. A discerning one might easily regard himself at present as the
      animalization of God.
    </p>
    <p>
      102. Discovering reciprocal love should really disenchant the lover with
      regard to the beloved. "What! She is modest enough to love even you? Or
      stupid enough? Or&mdash;or&mdash;-"
    </p>
    <p>
      103. THE DANGER IN HAPPINESS.&mdash;"Everything now turns out best for me,

      the Christians of today&mdash;burning us.
    </p>
    <p>
      105. The pia fraus is still more repugnant to the taste (the "piety") of
      the free spirit (the "pious man of knowledge") than the impia fraus. Hence
      the profound lack of judgment, in comparison with the Church,
      characteristic of the type "free spirit"&mdash;as ITS non-freedom.
    </p>
    <p>
      106. By means of music the very passions enjoy themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      107. A sign of strong character, when once the resolution has been taken,
      to shut the ear even to the best counter-arguments. Occasionally,
      therefore, a will to stupidity.
    </p>
    <p>
      108. There is no such thing as moral phenomena, but only a moral
      interpretation of phenomena.
    </p>
    <p>
      109. The criminal is often enough not equal to his deed: he extenuates and
      maligns it.

      wounded.
    </p>
    <p>
      112. To him who feels himself preordained to contemplation and not to
      belief, all believers are too noisy and obtrusive; he guards against them.

      embarrassed before him."
    </p>
    <p>
      114. The immense expectation with regard to sexual love, and the coyness
      in this expectation, spoils all the perspectives of women at the outset.
    </p>
    <p>
      115. Where there is neither love nor hatred in the game, woman's play is
      mediocre.
    </p>
    <p>
      116. The great epochs of our life are at the points when we gain courage
      to rebaptize our badness as the best in us.

      another, or of several other, emotions.
    </p>

      ourselves&mdash;"justifying" ourselves.
    </p>
    <p>

      remains weak, and is easily torn up.
    </p>
    <p>
      121. It is a curious thing that God learned Greek when he wished to turn
      author&mdash;and that he did not learn it better.
    </p>
    <p>
      122. To rejoice on account of praise is in many cases merely politeness of
      heart&mdash;and the very opposite of vanity of spirit.
    </p>

      123. Even concubinage has been corrupted&mdash;by marriage.
    </p>
    <p>
      124. He who exults at the stake, does not triumph over pain, but because
      of the fact that he does not feel pain where he expected it. A parable.
    </p>

      and then to get round them.
    </p>
    <p>
      127. In the eyes of all true women science is hostile to the sense of
      shame. They feel as if one wished to peep under their skin with it&mdash;or
      worse still! under their dress and finery.
    </p>
    <p>
      128. The more abstract the truth you wish to teach, the more must you
      allure the senses to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      129. The devil has the most extensive perspectives for God; on that
      account he keeps so far away from him:&mdash;the devil, in effect, as the
      oldest friend of knowledge.
    </p>
    <p>
      130. What a person IS begins to betray itself when his talent decreases,&mdash;when
      he ceases to show what he CAN do. Talent is also an adornment; an
      adornment is also a concealment.
    </p>
    <p>
      131. The sexes deceive themselves about each other: the reason is that in
      reality they honour and love only themselves (or their own ideal, to
      express it more agreeably). Thus man wishes woman to be peaceable: but in
      fact woman is ESSENTIALLY unpeaceable, like the cat, however well she may
      have assumed the peaceable demeanour.
    </p>
    <p>
      132. One is punished best for one's virtues.
    </p>
    <p>
      133. He who cannot find the way to HIS ideal, lives more frivolously and
      shamelessly than the man without an ideal.
    </p>
    <p>

      all evidence of truth.
    </p>
    <p>
      135. Pharisaism is not a deterioration of the good man; a considerable
      part of it is rather an essential condition of being good.
    </p>
    <p>
      136. The one seeks an accoucheur for his thoughts, the other seeks some
      one whom he can assist: a good conversation thus originates.
    </p>
    <p>
      137. In intercourse with scholars and artists one readily makes mistakes
      of opposite kinds: in a remarkable scholar one not infrequently finds a
      mediocre man; and often, even in a mediocre artist, one finds a very
      remarkable man.
    </p>
    <p>
      138. We do the same when awake as when dreaming: we only invent and
      imagine him with whom we have intercourse&mdash;and forget it immediately.
    </p>
    <p>
      139. In revenge and in love woman is more barbarous than man.
    </p>
    <p>
      140. ADVICE AS A RIDDLE.&mdash;"If the band is not to break, bite it first&mdash;secure
      to make!"
    </p>
    <p>
      141. The belly is the reason why man does not so readily take himself for
      a God.
    </p>
    <p>
      142. The chastest utterance I ever heard: "Dans le veritable amour c'est
      l'ame qui enveloppe le corps."
    </p>
    <p>
      143. Our vanity would like what we do best to pass precisely for what is
      most difficult to us.&mdash;Concerning the origin of many systems of
      morals.
    </p>
    <p>
      144. When a woman has scholarly inclinations there is generally something
      wrong with her sexual nature. Barrenness itself conduces to a certain
      virility of taste; man, indeed, if I may say so, is "the barren animal."
    </p>
    <p>
      145. Comparing man and woman generally, one may say that woman would not
      have the genius for adornment, if she had not the instinct for the
      SECONDARY role.
    </p>
    <p>
      146. He who fights with monsters should be careful lest he thereby become
      a monster. And if thou gaze long into an abyss, the abyss will also gaze
      into thee.
    </p>
    <p>
      147. From old Florentine novels&mdash;moreover, from life: Buona femmina e
      mala femmina vuol bastone.&mdash;Sacchetti, Nov. 86.
    </p>
    <p>
      148. To seduce their neighbour to a favourable opinion, and afterwards to
      believe implicitly in this opinion of their neighbour&mdash;who can do
      this conjuring trick so well as women?
    </p>
    <p>
      149. That which an age considers evil is usually an unseasonable echo of
      what was formerly considered good&mdash;the atavism of an old ideal.
    </p>
    <p>
      150. Around the hero everything becomes a tragedy; around the demigod
      everything becomes a satyr-play; and around God everything becomes&mdash;what?
      perhaps a "world"?
    </p>
    <p>
      151. It is not enough to possess a talent: one must also have your
      permission to possess it;&mdash;eh, my friends?
    </p>
    <p>
      152. "Where there is the tree of knowledge, there is always Paradise": so
      say the most ancient and the most modern serpents.
    </p>
    <p>
      153. What is done out of love always takes place beyond good and evil.
    </p>
    <p>
      154. Objection, evasion, joyous distrust, and love of irony are signs of
      health; everything absolute belongs to pathology.
    </p>
    <p>
      155. The sense of the tragic increases and declines with sensuousness.
    </p>
    <p>
      156. Insanity in individuals is something rare&mdash;but in groups,
      parties, nations, and epochs it is the rule.
    </p>
    <p>
      157. The thought of suicide is a great consolation: by means of it one
      gets successfully through many a bad night.
    </p>
    <p>
      158. Not only our reason, but also our conscience, truckles to our
      strongest impulse&mdash;the tyrant in us.
    </p>
    <p>
      159. One MUST repay good and ill; but why just to the person who did us
      good or ill?
    </p>
    <p>
      160. One no longer loves one's knowledge sufficiently after one has
      communicated it.
    </p>
    <p>
      161. Poets act shamelessly towards their experiences: they exploit them.
    </p>
    <p>
      162. "Our fellow-creature is not our neighbour, but our neighbour's
      neighbour":&mdash;so thinks every nation.
    </p>
    <p>
      163. Love brings to light the noble and hidden qualities of a lover&mdash;his
      rare and exceptional traits: it is thus liable to be deceptive as to his
      normal character.
    </p>
    <p>
      164. Jesus said to his Jews: "The law was for servants;&mdash;love God as
      I love him, as his Son! What have we Sons of God to do with morals!"
    </p>
    <p>
      165. IN SIGHT OF EVERY PARTY.&mdash;A shepherd has always need of a
      bell-wether&mdash;or he has himself to be a wether occasionally.
    </p>
    <p>

      one nevertheless tells the truth.

      precious.
    </p>
    <p>
      168. Christianity gave Eros poison to drink; he did not die of it,
      certainly, but degenerated to Vice.
    </p>
    <p>
      169. To talk much about oneself may also be a means of concealing oneself.
    </p>
    <p>
      170. In praise there is more obtrusiveness than in blame.
    </p>
    <p>
      171. Pity has an almost ludicrous effect on a man of knowledge, like

    </p>
    <p>

      sufficiently truthful.
    </p>
    <p>
      178. One does not believe in the follies of clever men: what a forfeiture
      of the rights of man!
    </p>
